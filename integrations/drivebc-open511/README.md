# DriveBC - Open511 Events

This integration is exposed as a REST service for consumption by DriveBC.  It forwards incoming API calls to the Open511 API and returns the results.  While it only acts as a proxy to the Open511 API, it can be modified to faciliate any data transformation and enrichment needs.
